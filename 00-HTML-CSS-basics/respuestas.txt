How could you add weight to the global font definition to win over the classes added by point 3?

What I thougth about this exercise is to implement the selector * {} to select all and add the weight
in the font-weigth property. Sometimes I use html * {} because I want all selector within html.




Imagine there is a declaration like class=”oh-no-inline-styles” style=”background:red” and you need 
to change the background to green without changing the inline style. How could you accomplish this?

In this case, I thought to put an id and then change the background color to green. That's because
id has more weigth than classes and selectors.
